# Comics.js

# This project has been archived

This is the old version of the aggregator and has been replaced with [comics-ts](https://github.com/kennep/comics-ts/). 
This code base will not be updated and security issues will not be fixed.

# Description

This is a very simple comic aggregator. It scrapes web pages with comics I'm interested in on the fly, and returns them all on one page.

It is written using node with a bit of cheerio on the server side, and React with jQuery on the client side.
